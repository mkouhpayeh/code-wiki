# Ansible

## Keywords
- Community :  is what most admins should install if they want to directly run Ansible.
  It contains the Ansible binaries, along with a slew of some of the most commonly used components, all packaged up and ready to go. This is the easiest way to get started.
- Core : is a stripped-down version that really only contains the essential components for Ansible to function. This means that to automate against most hosts, additional components will need to be installed.
  This is most often used by developers or admins that want to only install the absolutely required pieces.
- Naviagtor : 
- Container : is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient unit that includes all the necessary code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies to run an application consistently across different computing environments.
  That's a complicated definition.
- API : Application Programming Interface
