## Database, Dataset, Datasource

- **Database**: A database is the main data storage system. A structured collection of data stored electronically.

- **Data Source**: A data source is the connection definition that tells an application how and where to reach the database (or any other data provider). A configuration or connection string that defines:

    - Database type (SQL Server, Firebird, etc.)
    - Server name or IP
    - Database name
    - Credentials (username/password)

- **Dataset**: A dataset is a collection of data retrieved from a data source, often stored in memory for use in applications or reports. The result of a query or a group of tables you’re currently working with in code.
