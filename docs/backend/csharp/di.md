# Dependency Injection

---

## Dependency Injection Lifetimes
ASP.NET Core provides three main lifetimes for services registered in the Dependency Injection (DI) container.  
Each lifetime defines **how long an instance of a service lives** and **how it is shared**.

### Transient
- A **new instance is created every time** the service is requested
- Suitable for:
    - Lightweight classes
    - Stateless services
- ❌ Not suitable for database connections
- Example registration:
    ``` cs
    services.AddTransient<IEmailService, EmailService>();
    ```

### Scoped
- One instance is created **per HTTP request**    
- The **same instance** is shared within that request
- Suitable for:
    - Web requests
    - DbContext
    - Unit of Work pattern
- ✅ **Recommended for business logic**
- Example registration:

    ``` cs
    services.AddScoped<IOrderService, OrderService>();
    ```
        
### Singleton 
- Only **one instance for the whole application lifetime**
- Shared across all users and requests
- Suitable for:
    - Caching
    - Configuration
    - Logging
- ⚠️ Must be **thread-safe**
- Example registration:
    ``` cs
    services.AddSingleton<ICacheService, CacheService>();
    ```

- **Golden Rule** 
    - A service with a longer lifetime must NOT depend on a service with a shorter lifetime. **(This can cause memory leaks or unpredictable behavior)** 
    - ❌ Invalid dependencies:
        - Singleton → Scoped
        - Singleton → Transient

- **Quick Guide** 
    - Helper / Utility code → **Transient**
    - Business Logic → **Scoped**
    - Database Access (DbContext) → **Scoped**
    - Cache / Configuration → **Singleton**
